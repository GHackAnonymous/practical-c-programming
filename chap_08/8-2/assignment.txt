Exercise 8-2

The total resistance of n resistors in parallel is:

1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... + 1/Rn

Suppose we have a network of two resistors with the values 400 ohms and 200
ohms. Then our equation would be:

1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2

Substituting in the value of our resistors we get:

1/R = 1/400 + 1/200

1/R = 3/400

R = 400/3

So the total resistance of our two-resistor network is 133.3 ohms.

Write a program to compute the total resistance for any number of parallel
resistors.
