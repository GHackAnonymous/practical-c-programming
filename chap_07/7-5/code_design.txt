A prime number is any number divisible only by 1 and itself.

get number from user
for each number (n) between 2 and (number - 1)
	calculate number mod n
	if the result is zero
		(clean divisor)
		print "not a prime number"
		end program
	end if
end for

if we reached here, it is prime, so print that result.
