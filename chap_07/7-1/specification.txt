Available conversions:

* miles to kilometers

Enter a type and a value, e.g. "f 3.5" for 3.5 feet. A calculation is
made and returned in the equivalent metric measurement.

Enter "q" to quit.

Example session:

    % ./convert
    
    (m:miles g:gallons i:inches f:feet q:quit)
    Enter the unit type and value: f 3.5
    3.5 feet = 1.0668 meters
    
    (m:miles g:gallons i:inches f:feet q:quit)
    Enter the unit type and value: i 14
