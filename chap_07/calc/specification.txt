Preliminary Specification

Warning: this document is a preliminary specification. Any resemblance
to any software living or dead is purely coincidental.

Calc is a program that allows the user to turn a $2,000 computer into a
$1.98 four-function calculator. The program will add, subtract, multiply,
and divide simple integers.

Dividing by 0 results in an error message and the result register
is left unchanged.

When the program is run, it will zero the result register and display
the register's contents. The user can then type in an operator and number.
The result will be updated and displayed. The following operators are
valid:

Operator      Meaning

+             Addition
-             Subtraction
*             Multiplication
/             Division
q             Quit program

For example:

    calc
    Result: 0
    Enter operator and number: + 123
    Result: 123
    Enter operator and number: - 23
    Result: 100
    Enter operator and number: / 25
    Result: 4
    Enter operator and number: * 4
